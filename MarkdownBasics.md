# Quotes and Incantations of the Adeptus Mechanicus

## Runic Spaceflight: An Introduction
### Naval Flight Manual
Strike the first rune upon the engine's casing employing the chosen wrench. 
Its tip should be anointed with the oil of engineering using the proper 
incantation when the auspices are correct. Strike the second rune upon the 
engine's casing employing the arc-tip of the power-driver. If the second 
rune is not good, a third rune may be struck in like manner to the first. 
This is done according to the true ritual laid down by Scotti the Enginseer. 
A libation should be offered. If this sequence is properly observed the 
engines may be brought to full activation by depressing the large panel 
marked "ON".
